abstract="This chapter introduces the concept of restricted isometry constants. This is a more powerful tool than the less involved notion of coherence to assess the quality of a measurement matrix for sparse recovery. Some basic properties of the restricted isometry constants and of the related restricted orthogonality constants are presented first as well as relations between them. It is then established that small restricted isometry constants enable stable and robust recovery of sparse vectors via a variety of methods: â„“1-minimization, thresholding-based algorithms, and greedy algorithms.",
