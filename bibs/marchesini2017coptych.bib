abstract = {Coherent ptychographic imaging experiments often discard the majority of the flux from a light source to define the coherence of the illumination. Even when the coherent flux is sufficient, the stability required during an exposure is another important limiting factor. Partial coherence analysis can considerably reduce these limitations. A partially coherent illumination can often be written as the superposition of a single coherent illumination convolved with a separable translational kernel. This article proposes the gradient decomposition of the probe (GDP), a model that exploits translational kernel separability, coupling the variances of the kernel with the transverse coherence. An efficient first-order splitting algorithm ({\it GDP-ADMM}) for solving the proposed nonlinear optimization problem is described. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with Gaussian and binary kernel functions in fly-scan measurements. Remarkably, {\it GDP-ADMM} using nanoprobes produces satisfactory results even when the ratio between the kernel width and the beam size is more than one, or when the distance between successive acquisitions is twice as large as the beam width.},
