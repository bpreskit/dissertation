abstract="It is well-known that the second smallest eigenvalue$\lambda$2 of the difference Laplacian matrix of a graphG is related to the expansion properties ofG. A more detailed analysis of this relation is given. Upper and lower bounds on the diameter and the mean distance inG in terms of$\lambda$2 are derived.",
