\maketitle

% OGS manual (2007): "Students who do not wish to include a copyright notice
% within their doctoral dissertation or master.s thesis must include a second
% page, regardless. In this instance, the second page will be blank. This page
% does not have a page number."
\copyrightpage

% OGS manual (2007): "The signature page is always numbered as page 'iii'."
\approvalpage

% OGS manual (2007): "This section may be used to dedicate the doctoral
% dissertation or master's thesis to someone or to acknowledge particular
% persons. Within the usual margin restrictions, any format is acceptable for
% this page."
\begin{dedication}
This dissertation is lovingly dedicated to my brother, Charles Preskitt.
\end{dedication}

% OGS manual (2007): "An epigraph is a quotation that is pertinent but not
% integral to the text. Within the usual margin restrictions, any format is
% acceptable for this page."
\begin{epigraph}
For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow. -- Ecclesiastes 1:18
\end{epigraph}

% OGS manual (2007): "All doctoral dissertations or master's theses are
% required to use a table of contents."
\tableofcontents

% OGS manual (2007): If plates or illustrations such as figures, tables,
% graphs, slides, maps, diagrams, charts, photos, etc., are scattered
% throughout the doctoral dissertation or master's thesis, make a separate
% 'List of Figures', 'List of Illustrations', 'List of Tables', etc. to follow
% the table of contents."

% OGS manual (2007): "A biographical notice, or vita, is required only of
% doctoral students. Master's students do not include a vita." See the OGS
% manual for more detail.
\begin{vitapage}
% A list environment. Each item is a separate entry in the vita. Text between
% the brackets goes in the left column. Everything else goes in the right.
% Text wraps automatically, but you can force a line break with \\.
\begin{vita}
\item[2013] Bachelor of Science, Texas Christian University
\item[2013-2018] Teaching Assistant, University of California, San Diego
\item[2015] Master of Science, University of California, San Diego
\item[2016-2017] Associate Instructor, University of California, San Diego
\item[2018] Doctor of Philosophy, University of California, San Diego
\end{vita}

% Also a list. Each entry is a separate item. Unlike the vita, there is only
% one column, so no labels are needed. The list just makes formatting easy.

% Fields of Study is trickier. Each item is one field, and there are several
% entries in each item. Again, you can force a line break with \\, but note the
% \ \\ on the first line. This forces the label on a line by itself.
