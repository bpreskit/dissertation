The software and hardware used for the numerical evaluations included in \cref{sec:NumEval,sec:2d_num} is described in those sections.  The remainder of the numerical experiments (specifically, those contained in \cref{sec:span_fam_num,sec:ang_sync_num,sec:ptych_num}) were run on a laptop computer running Linux Mint 18.1 with an Intel\textcopyright~Core\textsuperscript{TM} i5-6300U CPU @ (2.40 GHz $\times$ 2).  For these sections, all computation was done using GNU Octave, version 4.0.0 \cite{eaton2015octave}, plots were produced using Gnuplot, version 4.6.7 \cite{williams2015gnuplot}, and the convex optimization problems were solved using SeDuMi version 1.32 \cite{sturm1999sedumi}.  The scripts used to test the methods described in the dissertation and produce the charts and graphs presented are available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/bpreskit/pr_code}.
