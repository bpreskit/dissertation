\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper new and improved deterministic robust recovery guarantees are proven for the phase retrieval problem using local correlation measurements.  In addition, a new practical phase retrieval algorithm is presented which is both faster and more noise robust than previously existing approaches (e.g., alternating projections) for such local measurements.  

Future work might include the exploration of more general classes of measurements which are guaranteed to lead to well conditioned linear systems  of the type used to reconstruct $X \approx X_0$ in line 1 of Algorithm~\ref{alg:phaseRetrieval1}.  Currently two deterministic measurement constructions are known (recall, e.g., Section~\ref{sec:MeasMatrix}) -- it should certainly be possible to construct more general families of such measurements.

Other interesting avenues of inquiry include the theoretical analysis of the magnitude estimate approach proposed in Section~\ref{sec:MagEstImpNumerical} in combination with the rest of Algorithm~\ref{alg:phaseRetrieval1}.  Alternate phase retrieval approaches might also be developed by using such local block eigenvector-based methods for estimating phases too, instead of just using the single global top eigenvector as currently done in line 3 of Algorithm~\ref{alg:phaseRetrieval1}.

Finally, more specific analysis of the performance of the proposed methods using masked/windowed Fourier measurements (recall Section~\ref{sec:STFT}) would also be interesting.  In particular, an analysis of the performance of such approaches as a function of the bandwidth of the measurement mask/window could be particularly enlightening.  One might also consider extending the discrete results of this paper to the analytic setting by, e.g., expanding on \cite{merhi2017recovery}.
